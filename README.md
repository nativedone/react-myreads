# MyReads Project

This is the first assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. It shows a basic app for reading recording, where the state is managed directly by React using setState() method and the new context API.

# Highlight

## The new React context API

The project uses the new React context API to handle shared state and actions used on both LibraryPage and SearchPage.

# TL;DR

To run the project:

* install all project dependencies with `yarn`
* start the development server with `yarn start`
